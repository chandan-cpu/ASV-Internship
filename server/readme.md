ERR_HTTP_HEADERS_SENT Error - Simple Explanation
What it means: You tried to send a response to the client twice, but HTTP only allows ONE response per request.

----->try and catch vitrt abar next logua pist next ako logobo nlga---<
Real-world analogy: It's like trying to answer the same phone call twice - once you hang up, you can't pick up and answer again.

What was happening in your code:

User makes request → /me (get profile)
Middleware runs → checks if user is logged in
Problem: Your middleware had a bug - it was calling the next function TWICE
Result: Your profile function ran TWICE
First run: Sends response successfully ✅
Second run: Tries to send response again ❌ ERROR!

#The bug was here:
// In auth.middleware.js - BAD CODE
try {
    // ... check token ...
    next(); // First call - GOOD
} catch (error) {
    // ... handle error ...
}
next(); // Second call - BAD! This always runs

Fixed version:

// GOOD CODE
try {
    // ... check token ...
    next(); // Only one call
} catch (error) {
    // ... handle error ...
}
// No extra next() call
